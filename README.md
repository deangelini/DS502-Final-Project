# Predicting Release Year of Songs Based on Timbre Features Using Regression

Final Project for Statistical Methods for Data Science using regression algorithms. 

Abstract – The evolution of sound quality 
and recording techniques has contributed 
greatly to the way music is recorded today. 
Sound features of songs have been 
documented from the 1920s to the 2010s, 
allowing data scientists to process, analyze, 
and predict the release year of these songs. 
For this project, a dataset of 515,345 songs 
was analyzed to see if timbre features can 
predict the release year of a song. Various 
machine learning algorithms were
compared based on their test mean squared 
error and R-squared error. The significance 
of these features was also analyzed to see if 
any one feature had more of an impact on 
predicting a song’s release year. It was 
concluded that the linear regression method 
had the best performance when including 
an interaction term between the two most 
correlated features.
